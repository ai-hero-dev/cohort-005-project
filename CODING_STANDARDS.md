# Coding standards

**A `CODING_STANDARDS.md` applies to the directory it sits in, and everything
under it.** This file is the root, so the five rules below apply everywhere.
A rule that is only true in one area lives in that area's file:

| File                             | Applies to                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `app/db/CODING_STANDARDS.md`     | The schema, migrations and every query     |
| `app/routes/CODING_STANDARDS.md` | Loaders, actions and anything they reach   |
| `app/components/CODING_STANDARDS.md` | React components and what they render  |

Read the root file and the one for the directory you are editing. Nothing
else.

## Fail with a thrown response, not a return value

A loader or an action that cannot continue throws. It does not return an
error shape for the component to unpack.

```ts
if (!course) throw data("Course not found", { status: 404 });
```

The route then has one success path. A returned error shape gives every
component a second path to forget about.

## Parse untrusted input with a schema

Form data, search parameters and request bodies get a zod schema before the
values reach any query. Do not read `formData.get("x") as string`. The cast
is a lie the type checker believes.

## Do not write `any`, and do not write `!`

Both switch the type checker off at the exact point you are least sure. If a
value can be missing, narrow it with a check. If you cannot name the type,
the shape is wrong — fix the shape.

## Let the code explain itself

Name and extract until a comment is unnecessary. A comment earns its place
only for a _why_ the code cannot express: a constraint, a decision, a link to
the ADR behind it. A comment that restates _what_ the code does goes stale the
first time the code changes.

## Arrange tests through the module under test

Test setup calls the module's own functions. When the function you need does
not exist, add it to the module rather than inserting rows directly, so a
change to how the module stores its data leaves its tests alone.

## What was taken out, and why

This file had grown to ninety-four rules. Most of them went, in two piles.

**A linter already does it.** Indentation, quote style, semicolons, trailing
commas, trailing whitespace, the final newline, line width, import order. A
rule a machine enforces does not need a human to remember it. If one of these
starts slipping, add it to the formatter, not here.

**Nobody was ever going to be told it twice.** `const` over `let`, `===` over
`==`, arrow callbacks, not abbreviating a variable name, naming a boolean
`isThing`, not committing commented-out code, not leaving a `console.log`,
writing types the compiler can already infer. These restate the language, or
they restate taste. A standard is a thing a review found, wrote down, and
never had to say again — not a style guide.

Process rules went too: branch names, squashing, what a pull request may
contain. True, and not about the code in front of you.
