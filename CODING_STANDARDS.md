# Coding standards

## Fail with a thrown response, not a return value

A loader or an action that cannot continue throws. It does not return an
error shape for the component to unpack.

```ts
if (!course) throw data("Course not found", { status: 404 });
```

The route then has one success path. A returned error shape gives every
component a second path to forget about.

## Parse untrusted input with a schema

Form data, search parameters and request bodies get a zod schema before the
values reach any query. Do not read `formData.get("x") as string`. The cast
is a lie the type checker believes.

## Do not write `any`, and do not write `!`

Both switch the type checker off at the exact point you are least sure. If a
value can be missing, narrow it with a check. If you cannot name the type,
the shape is wrong — fix the shape.

## Let the code explain itself

Name and extract until a comment is unnecessary. A comment earns its place
only for a _why_ the code cannot express: a constraint, a decision, a link to
the ADR behind it. A comment that restates _what_ the code does goes stale the
first time the code changes.

## Arrange tests through the module under test

Test setup calls the module's own functions. When the function you need does
not exist, add it to the module rather than inserting rows directly, so a
change to how the module stores its data leaves its tests alone.

## Import a module through its entry points, never into its subfolders

Every directory under `app/modules/` is a deep module. Its **entry points**
are its root files, and they are its whole public surface. Everything in a
subfolder — `lib/`, `tests/`, anything else you add — is implementation, and is
private.

```ts
import { getInstructorAnalytics } from "~/modules/instructor-analytics"; // yes
import { getTopBuyers } from "~/modules/instructor-analytics/lib/overview"; // no
```

A module whose interface hides its implementation only hides it while nobody
is allowed to reach past it. Give one caller a deep import and the
implementation is now the interface, and you find that out the day you try to
change it.

Four things follow, and they are the ones people get wrong:

- **A module's own tests go through the entry points too.** A test that imports
  `lib/` is a test of the implementation, and it fails the next time the
  implementation is correctly rewritten.
- **Do not write a barrel.** An `index.ts` that re-exports the whole subtree has
  an interface as wide as its implementation. Expose several small entry points
  instead.
- **Two modules that import each other are one module.** Cycles are an error.
- **The route does not take the logic back.** Once a loader's work is in a
  module, the route hands it the request and renders the answer. A new figure
  goes in the module, not in a query beside the call.

`npm run lint:boundaries` enforces all of this with dependency-cruiser. The
rules are errors, not warnings. See
[app/modules/README.md](./app/modules/README.md).
