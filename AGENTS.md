## Verification checks

Do these checks in this order before you report a change to `app/` as complete:

1. `npm run typecheck`
2. `npm run test`

## When something breaks

| Symptom                                         | Cause                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 401 "Select a user from the DevUI panel"        | No user in the session — switch users and country in the floating panel (`app/components/dev-ui.tsx`). |
| `tsc` reports every `./+types/*` import missing | Typegen has not run. Use `npm run typecheck`, which runs `react-router typegen` first.                 |

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker
