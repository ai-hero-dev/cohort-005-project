Split each file before you commit. Do not delete code or squash it onto fewer
lines to get under the limit.

How to split:
- Find the seams. Look for groups of functions, components, or tests that
  change together and share little with the rest of the file.
- Route modules (app/routes/*): keep the loader, action, and page component in
  the route file. Move the business logic into a module in app/modules/ and
  sub-components into their own files in app/components/.
- Logic that is already in a module (app/modules/<name>/): split it into more
  files under lib/. Keep the entry points (index.ts, index.server.ts) small. Do
  not add a barrel file. See app/modules/README.md.
- Tests: split by the behaviour under test, one file per area (for example
  <name>.refunds.test.ts, <name>.permissions.test.ts). Move shared fixtures
  into a fixtures file in the same tests/ folder.
- Scripts and seed data: move large data literals into their own files and
  import them.

When you are done, run \`npm run check\` and commit again.`);
